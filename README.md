## Technical Test for Frontend Junior Developer [REMOTE]

This is a simple frontend test for the Frontend Junior Developer position at [Onairparking](https://onairparking.com/)!

## The problem

You need to create a coupom page with some coupoms that will be shared by our users. You can found the design at **design** directory in this repository.

## Recommendations

-
- We use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, grid, space, font-size, font-weight, etc. and [ant.design](https://ant.design) for components. Sometimes we create a component with tailwind and ant.design.
- Worry about the UX and UI of the design.
- Use Git with good commit messages.
- We use [mobX](https://mobx.com) for state management. But for this test use only React Hooks if necessary.
- For development use the command `npm run devproxy`.
- After the implementation Create a Pull Request
