## Technical Test for Frontend Junior Developer [REMOTE]

This is a simple frontend test for the Frontend Junior Developer position at [Onairparking](https://onairparking.com/)!

## The problem

You need to create a coupon page with some coupons that will be shared by our users. You can find the design at **design** directory in this repository.

## The solution

- Clone this repository: [onairparking-frontend-test](https://github.com/devopsnoson/onairparking-frontend-test)
- See the recommentations
- After the implementation create a **zip file** and send to the email that you received about the test.
- Any doubts please contact the owner of this repository or the people that are interviewing you.

## Recommendations

- We use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, grid, space, font-size, font-weight, etc. and [ant.design](https://ant.design) for components. Sometimes we create a component with tailwind and ant.design.
- Think in componentization.
- Worry about the UX and UI of the design.
- Use Git with good commit messages.
- We use [mobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for state management. But for this test use only React Hooks if necessary.
- For development use the command `npm run devproxy`.
